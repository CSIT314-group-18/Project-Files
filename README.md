download and install the latest version of XAMPP
(which is a distrobution of apache that works beautifully on windows and comes with php and mysql built in)

Turn apache and mysql on in the xampp gui window (after running xampp as admin)

Go into the admin section of php and create a database 'demo'

Copy the text of the test file of sql I wrote, to create the sql columns of users and passwords in your db 'demo'

Transfer my early php pages from the repository into the 'htdocs' folder in the installation folder of xampp

Type in your browser 'loaclahost/register.php' and look at Lewis' magic work
